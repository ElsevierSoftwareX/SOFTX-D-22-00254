# Coding guidelines
Since **<kbd>life<sup>x</sup></kbd>** is a fairly large project with lots of contributors we use a
set of [coding guidelines](https://lifex.gitlab.io/lifex/coding-guidelines.html)
to keep the style of the source code in the library consistent.
If you are new to the project then we will work with you to ensure
your contributions are formatted with this style, so please do not think of
it as a road block if you would like to contribute some code.
