# Referencing **<kbd>life<sup>x</sup></kbd>**

In addition to the terms imposed by the LGPLv3 or later, we ask you for the
following courtesy.

```
Every publication presenting numerical results obtained with the help
of lifex should state the name of the library, include a link to the

lifex references.
