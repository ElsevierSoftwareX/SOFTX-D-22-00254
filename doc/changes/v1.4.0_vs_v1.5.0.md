## Changes between v1.4.0 and v1.5.0
- **Changed**: `utils::initialize_matrix()` does not take `uses_bddc` and `active_dofs` as inputs anymore. Active dofs are not used anywhere. (Pasquale Claudio Africa, 2022/07/14).
- **Removed**: removed `WITH_BDDC` flag. BDDC support is supposed to be integrated into the next deal.II release. (Pasquale Claudio Africa, 2022/07/14).
- **New**: new `TimeInterpolation` methods: `SmoothingCubicSpline`, `DerivativeLinearInterpolation`, `DerivativeSplineInterpolation`. (Michele Bucelli, Alberto Zingaro, 2022/07/05).
- **New**: implemented `MeshOptimization` class that untangles and improves mesh quality by solving an optimization problem. (Michele Bucelli, 2022/06/30).
- **New**: implemented non-linear optimization solver class `NonLinearConjugateGradient`. (Michele Bucelli, 2022/06/30).
